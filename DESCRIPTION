Package: graphlayouts
Title: A set of layout algorithms for network visualization
Version: 0.0.5.9000
Authors@R: person("David", "Schoch", email = "david.schoch@manchester.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The package implements several new layout algorithms to visualize networks. 
    Most are based on the concept of stress majorization. Some more specific algorithms allow to emphasize 
    hidden group structures in networks or focus on specific nodes.
